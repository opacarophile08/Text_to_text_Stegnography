1276	eng	Let's try something.
1277	eng	I have to go to sleep.
1280	eng	Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
1282	eng	Muiriel is 20 now.
1283	eng	The password is "Muiriel".
1284	eng	I will be back soon.
1286	eng	I'm at a loss for words.
1287	eng	This is never going to end.
1288	eng	I just don't know what to say.
1289	eng	That was an evil bunny.
1290	eng	I was in the mountains.
1291	eng	Is it a recent picture?
1292	eng	I don't know if I have the time.
1294	eng	Education in this world disappoints me.
1295	eng	You're in better shape than I am.
1296	eng	You are in my way.
1298	eng	This will cost €30.
1299	eng	I make €100 a day.
1300	eng	I may give up soon and just nap instead.
1301	eng	It's because you don't want to be alone.
1302	eng	That won't happen.
1303	eng	Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
1304	eng	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
1305	eng	I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
1306	eng	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
1308	eng	I miss you.
1309	eng	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
1310	eng	I always liked mysterious characters more.
1311	eng	You should sleep.
1312	eng	I'm going to go.
1313	eng	I told them to send me another ticket.
1314	eng	You're so impatient with me.
1315	eng	I can't live that kind of life.
1316	eng	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317	eng	I never liked biology.
1318	eng	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1319	eng	If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
1320	eng	It is unfortunately true.
1321	eng	They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
1322	eng	Most people think I'm crazy.
1323	eng	No I'm not; you are!
1324	eng	That's MY line!
1325	eng	He's kicking me!
1326	eng	Are you sure?
1327	eng	Then there is a problem...
1328	eng	Oh, there's a butterfly!
1329	eng	Hurry up.
1330	eng	It doesn't surprise me.
1332	eng	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
1333	eng	It depends on the context.
1334	eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
1335	eng	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
1336	eng	I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
1337	eng	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1338	eng	America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money.
1339	eng	I'm so fat.
1340	eng	So what?
1341	eng	I'm gonna shoot him.
1342	eng	I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.
1343	eng	I'm just saying!
1344	eng	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345	eng	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1346	eng	This is what I would have said.
1347	eng	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1348	eng	That's because you're a girl.
1349	eng	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
1350	eng	It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
1351	eng	It would be something I'd have to program.
1352	eng	I don't intend to be selfish.
1353	eng	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354	eng	How many close friends do you have?
1355	eng	I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
1356	eng	This is always the way it has been.
1357	eng	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1358	eng	One can always find time.
1359	eng	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
1360	eng	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1361	eng	When I woke up, I was sad.
1362	eng	That is somewhat explained at the end.
1363	eng	I thought you liked to learn new things.
1364	eng	Most people write about their daily life.
1365	eng	If I could send you a marshmallow, Trang, I would.
1366	eng	In order to do that, you have to take risks.
1367	eng	Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
1368	eng	Why do you ask?
1369	eng	I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.
1370	eng	I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
1371	eng	I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
1372	eng	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373	eng	How long did you stay?
1374	eng	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
1375	eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1376	eng	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1377	eng	I don't want to lose my ideas, even though some of them are a bit extreme.
1378	eng	I think I have a theory about that.
1379	eng	That is intriguing.
1380	eng	You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
1381	eng	I do not have an account in these forums.
1382	eng	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
1383	eng	I didn't know where it came from.
1384	eng	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
1385	eng	This is not important.
1386	eng	I didn't like it.
1387	eng	She's asking how that's possible.
1388	eng	You're just running away from life's problems.
1389	eng	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
1390	eng	There's a problem there that you don't see.
1391	eng	You can do it.
1392	eng	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1393	eng	I wish I could go to Japan.
1394	eng	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
1395	eng	I have to go to bed.
1396	eng	After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
1397	eng	I won't ask you anything else today.
1398	eng	It may freeze next week.
1399	eng	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1400	eng	The police will get you to find the bullets.
1401	eng	Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.
1402	eng	That wasn't my intention.
1403	eng	Thanks for your explanation.
1404	eng	Theoretically, I'm doing math.
1406	eng	If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
1407	eng	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
1408	eng	I don't know what you mean.
1409	eng	My computer has got to be useful for something.
1410	eng	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
1411	eng	Uh, now it's really weird...
1412	eng	If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
1413	eng	One can't expect everything from schools.
1414	eng	There are many words that I don't understand.
1415	eng	I don't like it when mathematicians who know much more than I do can't express themselves explicitly.
1416	eng	You're really not stupid.
1417	eng	I need to ask you a silly question.
1418	eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
1419	eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
1420	eng	Can it be phrased in another way?
1421	eng	No one will know.
1422	eng	I found a solution, but I found it so fast that it can't be the right solution.
1423	eng	It seems interesting to me.
1424	eng	Except that here, it's not so simple.
1425	eng	I like candlelight.
1426	eng	What did you answer?
1427	eng	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
1428	eng	It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
1429	eng	You never have class or what?!
1430	eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
1431	eng	Where is the problem?
1432	eng	I can only wait.
1433	eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1434	eng	I love you.
1435	eng	I don't like you anymore.
1436	eng	I am curious.
1437	eng	Congratulations!
1438	eng	I don't want to wait that long.
1439	eng	Why don't you come visit us?
1440	eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442	eng	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443	eng	I don't know what to do anymore.
1444	eng	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
1445	eng	I hate chemistry.
1446	eng	I didn't want this to happen.
1447	eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
1449	eng	What other options do I have?
1450	eng	I am not much of a traveller.
1451	eng	I have nothing better to do.
1452	eng	I can't explain it either.
1453	eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
1454	eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
